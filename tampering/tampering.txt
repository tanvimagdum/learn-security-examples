The vulnerability in the insecure version lies in the lack of input sanitization, allowing for HTML injection attacks (also known as cross-site scripting or XSS). This vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

 The secure version prevents this vulnerability by implementing input sanitization using the escapeHTML function. This function escapes special HTML characters in user input, rendering injected scripts harmless. As a result, the secure version mitigates the risk of tampering attacks by ensuring that user input is properly sanitized before being displayed on the web page.
