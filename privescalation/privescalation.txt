The vulnerability lies in the lack of authentication and authorization checks when updating user roles. insecure.js allows any user, even non-administrative users, to update user roles, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges and gain administrative access, compromising the security of the system.
secure.js addresses the vulnerability by implementing authentication and authorization checks using session management. It checks whether the user making the request is authenticated and has administrative privileges before allowing them to update user roles. By verifying the user's identity and role, secure.js prevents unauthorized users from escalating their privileges and restricts role updates to authorized administrators only.

Additional security mechanisms:
1. If user input is used in database queries, ensure that it is properly sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.
2. Require additional authentication factors, such as OTPs or biometric authentication, for sensitive operations like role updates.
